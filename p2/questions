1. What should the ttl be when construct an ICMP reply?


2. "the IP source address set as the router's interface address." equivalent to the dst of the incoming ICMP?


3. When generating ICMP error messages, are the source ip and source eth the same as those of the router output port?


4. Will the router drop the ICMP error messages if it cannot find the next hop in its forwarding table?


5. Do all packets consist of EtherNet, IPv4 and ICMP? Also I see a mk_udp function in the test skeleton, can we ignore the udp packet for this project?



Sanity check
1. Do we need to check the dst ethaddr of the packet matches the ethaddr of the input port?
2. Do we need to check the src ipaddr and dst ipaddr of an ARP reply/request have the same network number?
3. Can we make the following assumptions about the forwarding table?
  - Four tokens(subnetnumber subnetmask nexthopipaddr portname) each line, with a single white space as the delemiter.
  - No leading and trailing nonalphanumeric characters
  - No comment
  - Each line is ended with a '\n'.
  - The next hop ip address and the ip address of its router-eth must be in the same network
